### QuickSight Visualization

* Up to 20 visuals per analysis

* Fields list

    * Dimensions = blue icons

    * Measures = green icons

* Possible to convert measures to dimensions and vice-versa

#### Visual Types

* **AutoGraph** - select fields, allow QS to select most appropriate viz type for you

* **Bar Charts** - horizontal (use dimension for y-axis) and vertical (use dimension for x-axis)

    * Single measure and multi-measure

    * Clustered bar charts

* **Line charts** - better suited for date fields

    * Single measure, multiple measures, dimension over period of time

* **Area Line Chart**

* **Pivot Tables** - can change row sort order, apply statistical functions

* **Scatter plot** - 2-3 measures for a dimension

* **Tree Map** - hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles, 1-2 measures for a dimension

* **Pie Chart**

* **Heat Map** - identify trends and outliers

* **Story** - preserve multiple iterations of an analysis, play sequentially to provide a narrative about the analyzed data

* **Dashboard** - read-only snapshot of an analysis

**For the Exam:**

* Know what a dimension is, what is a measure, and how they’re used in the visuals

* Know the visual types and what they’re ideal for

* Not too many questions on QS on the exam (maybe a couple)
